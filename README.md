## Game Description
The game places the user on a minefield where the user must reveal all of the safe spaces without pressing a bomb. The game adds an unique twist to the classic game, Minesweeper, by Curt Johnson. This twist involves the use of colors to group different bombs, adding a new level of difficulty and strategy to the game. A secret hint is hidden in the game to ease the difficulty this new twist brings to the game. The game was coded using `Java` and `CSS`.

## How to Play
When the game launches, the player is met with the Title screen. The player can then choose between 3 pre-defined game modes or customize their own. Next, the player can interact with the minefield. The minefield contains 3 types of boxes: Bombs, Numbers, and Whitespaces. The player can either choose to reveal or flag a certain box. However, the user cannot flag a different color bomb unless they have flagged all bombs of their current color. The player must reveal all non-bomb boxes to win the game.
