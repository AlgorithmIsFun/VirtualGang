## Game Description
The game places the user on a minefield where the user must reveal all of the safe spaces without pressing a bomb. The game adds an unique twist to the classic game, Minesweeper, by Curt Johnson. This twist involves the use of colors to group different bombs, adding a new level of difficulty and strategy to the game. A secret hint is hidden in the game to ease the difficulty this new twist brings to the game. The game was coded using `Java` and `CSS`.
