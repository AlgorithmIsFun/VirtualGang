# Please discuss your architectural decisions below.

High Level Architecture:

	MVC
	To keep the code simple, a partial MVC was implemented.
	
	Model
	The Model captures enough information to re-draw the sketch of
	the user.
	
	View+Controller
	There is a View class as well as a few, what we call, view components.
	The View class captures the Stage as well
	as containing all of its components.
	View components are meant to be contained in the main View.
	Examples of view components are PaintPanel and ShapeChooserPanel.
	
	The View class, and view components all implements their own controller.
	For example, the PaintPanel listens to its own MouseEvents.
	This is instead of separating out the Controller from the View. This choice
	was made to simplify the code, yet still keep it modular and clear.
	
	Each view component can see the containing View as well as the Model
	as appropriate. This means that each view component can speak to the
	other view components. An example of this is when the ShapeChooserPanel
	buttons are clicked, resulting in a mode change in the PaintPanel.
	
---------------------------------------------------------------------
TODO!!! Add in more architecture and discussion. For example, 
do you do something interesting to fix the association between the 
ShapeChooser and the PaintPanel? How about the PaintModel, something
is clearly wrong with it. Can you come up with a better architecture?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

DESIGN PATTERNS USED
	TODO!!! If you introduce a Design Pattern to solve a problem, 
	discuss it below. Only add design patterns if they simplify and improve
	the code. I see at least two that would greatly improve code. 
		
	Strategy:
	Command:
	Singleton:
	Composite:
	Factory:
	Builder:
	Observer/Observable:
	... (any others you find useful) ...
